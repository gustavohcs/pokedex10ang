### This is an application to simulate a pokedex without any bootstrap or angular material.

To run this project, angular requires Node.js in your system (version 8.x or 10.x).

Node has the Node Package Manager (NPM), which we need for installing Angular CLI and other programs (packages).

Please follow this guide to correctly install node and npm:

After youâ€™ve installed NPM, you can install Angular CLI as the 2nd step. Open your terminal or command prompt and type the command below:

```npm install -g @angular/cli```

At the directory of the application execute 
```npm i npm-check-updates``` and
```npm install```

Then, to finally run the application with the terminal or prompt, in the directory of the application, type 

```ng serve```
